For this 3 part tutorial, we will need 1 form, and within that form: 1 button, 5 textBoxes, and 5 labels.  We will then
rename our labels to Properties, Subject, Body, Email and Password, from the top down in that order.  Mext we will rename
the form1 to Email Sender and the button to Send Email.  

Next we will drag and drop in a groupBox, from our Toolbox then highlight the two labels Email and Password, along with
the two texBoxes associated with them and drag them into the groupBox.  You can now rename the groupbox to Credentials
and drag the group into place, within the form.  see tutorial 74 Emailer.png.

Next we will need a toolTip from the Toolbox.  So drag one into form1, then click in the textBox under 'Recipients' to
be able to go to the textBoxes properties, and look in the list for ToolTip, and write the following in the space provided.
"When providing more than one email address, please seperate 
addresses with a semi-colon ;'

Then for password security, while typing in a password, we will make the characters entered appear as a asterisk *, to
keep prying eyes at bay.  Click in the textBox next to the label, password, and go to the textBox's properties.  In the
passwordChar field, put in a *.

Next we will make it so that the user cannot maximise the form.  Click form to se properties, and under the MaximiseBox,
set it to False.  To keep the user from resizing the form we will go to FormBorderStyle and set it to FixedDialog.

Last we will go over to icon.com and put 'send' in thier searchbox and choose a 16px or 24px size send icon an download
it.  Click on the 'send email' button and go into properties, find image then navigate to the icon you downloaded, locally
and choose it.  Now us the ImageAlign, to align the icon to the far left middle.  Then go to your Text properties for the
button and align the text to the right middle, using textAlign, then resize the button till it looks like you want it to.

guys i can't find tooltip in my properties. can someone help me with it? i'm using VS 2013


+Ruben Hovasapyan You must go into the toolbox to create (drag and drop) the tooltip first! Press Ctrl + Alt + X, if 
you can't find the Toolbox. Upgrade your VS to VS 2015 Community/Enterprise :D.





in case anyone needs this, to type " • " you can push the "alt" button on your keyboard, and type the number 7 in your 
numberpad, not the 7 in the row on top of "qwertyuiop" but the one to the right of everything •••••••

Or they can copy the • from here and paste it into passwordChar. 





You can also add an icon for the application.
