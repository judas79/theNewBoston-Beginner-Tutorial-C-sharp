All we'll need for this lesson is button1, about substrings, which are part of the string class.  first we will create a string, that 
consists of a first and last name.

			// L49 string
            string sFullName = "John Smith";


Supposed we only want the last name.  We will use the substring method to get the part of the string, we want, and put it into another
string, as its own entity.  We keep the character we want, from the original string, by first, marking the starting point, then the 
amount of characters, you want to keep, including spaces, if you wish to keep them.


            // get substring of string 
            // (starting address of what you want to get, how many characters you wish to get
            string sLastName = sFullName.Substring(5, 5);
            string sFirstName = sFullName.Substring(0, 4);

            MessageBox.Show("last name: " + sLastName + ",\nfirst name: " + sFirstName);


If you want to get the characters from a certain point, all the way to the end of the string, you don't need to specify the second 
parameter, which is the amount of characters.

			// get starting point through all the characters, to the end
            string sToEndName = sFullName.Substring(3);

            MessageBox.Show("last name: " + sLastName + ",\nfirst name: " + sFirstName + ",\npartial name: " + sToEndName);

i think it would be much better to use
string[] array = Name.split(' ');
