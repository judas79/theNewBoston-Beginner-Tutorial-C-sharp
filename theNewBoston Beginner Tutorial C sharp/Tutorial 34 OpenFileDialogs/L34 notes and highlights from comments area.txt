In this lesson we will need a button1 and textbox1 to learn how to use OpenFileDialogs.  There are two ways to create an OpenFileDialog.
From the toolbox drag it onto your form, or create in code, within your form.  We will create one from code.  Inside the button1 body,
we type: OpenFileDialog, then a name, equals, new, OpenFileDialog, with parenthesis, then a semi-colon.


 private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            // L34 create and use a new openfiledialog
            OpenFileDialog ofd = new OpenFileDialog();
        }

Open dialogfiledialog is commonly used to browse and open a file.  We will not be doing that yet.  To display the open dialog to the 
user, we will call the show dialog method.

			// call show dialog to see open dialog
            ofd.ShowDialog();

Now that we can browse to folders and files, but are not set up to open one, we will make sure that we indeed opened a file, even 
though we don't see, the actual opened file.  The OK, is an enumeration, so if ofd.ShowDialog() is equal to an enumeration, this sees
it as open.  If you click cancel or the X in the dialog box, you will get a popup that says "File did not open", if you open one you
get the inverse, message.


            string myFileStatus = "";

            // check to see if file opened or not
            if (ofd.ShowDialog() == System.Windows.Forms.DialogResult.OK)
                 myFileStatus = "File is Open";

            else myFileStatus = "File did not open";

            MessageBox.Show(myFileStatus);


To get the path and the filename you just opened, we use our open file dialog name.FileName:

			// get the file path and file name of the file you opened
            MessageBox.Show(ofd.FileName);


To get  only the file name use SafeFilename:


To restrict what file types, we can open using the open file dialog:

            // restrict file types that can be opened
            ofd.Filter = "PDF text / image | *.pdf";

To add more than one file type that can be opened by file dialog:

			// restrict file types that can be opened
            ofd.Filter = "PDF text / image|*.pdf|TXT text|*.txt|YOMOMA ho|*.uho|All Files|*.*";


To change the title of your open file dialog box:

			// change default title of open file dialog box
            ofd.Title = "Open Folders & Files";

I was playing with the filter and i found out that for All Files is . or just **  using . (the dot) is not actually necessary, you 
could write like this "PNG Image | *png | BIK ....and so on






don't forget Using System.IO;





do we need to have the button? what can i delete to get rid of it?

Nope you dont  need a button to open File Dialogs :)
