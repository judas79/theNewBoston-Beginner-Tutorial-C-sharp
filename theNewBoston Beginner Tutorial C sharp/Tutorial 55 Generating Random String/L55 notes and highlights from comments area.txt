We will need button1 and textBox1 for this lesson on generating Random Strings.  First we will create a instanc of Random, then a char
array to hold the letters of the alphabet, for this example.  The char array is created from a string that is converted to a char array.
The letters in the array, do not need to be in any order, since this array will be used to get the Random letters.

			// L54 the Random class instance
            Random IRandom = new Random();

            // L55 char array, all letters of the alphabet (string), converted to char array
            char[] cLetters = "zxcvbnmasdfghjklqwertyuiop".ToCharArray();


So we will generate a random number to represent the index number for the cLetter, which will point to the random letter.  This will\
point at a single index within the array which is the letter from the char var. cLetter., We will, use .ToString to display in 
messagebox.
			
			
			// generate one random index number to define the index for chars letter
            MessageBox.Show(cLetters[IRandom.Next(0, 25)].ToString());


To get a few or many letters at one time we will use a for statement and create an empty string:


			// generate more than one letter using a for statement
            string sRandom = "";
            for(int iCount=0; iCount<5; iCount++)
            {
                // add chars to string (+=)
                sRandom += cLetters[IRandom.Next(0, 25)].ToString();
            }
            MessageBox.Show(sRandom);








*********************** highlights from the comments area **************************







Computers count from 0.
So if u want to find something in 26-long array, u search from index 0 to 25 (which will give us 26 options).







Random.Next(0,25) will not ever return 25, because the upper bound is exclusive. So you will never get to the 'z' character. You 
should always add 1 to the maxValue, if you want it to be included.

Yup!

array starts with index 0 dumb ass

 u selve dumb ass bc u dont know anything about it, hes right
it dont mind if it starts with 0






I want to make a random string that prints out the words "rock", "paper", "scissors" not random letters. Idk if you can help me out?


Yes. Change the letter pool to "R, P, S". R stands for rock, P stands for paper, and S stands for scissors. Now, if you want the words
to show, you can do that if the text in textbox one is "R", then the text in textbox two is rock.






How would I be able to display them to labels? 

label1.Text = (letters[R.Next(0, 25)].ToString());

label1.Text = randomstring.ToString();







yes you can use split method to put al strings in string array and than you randomly go through then
stringArray[Random.Next()]     and if you want to be shore to not make some string twice just use if statement if it's been already 
used







public List<string> randomColour = new List<string>();

int num = Random.Range(0, 12);
 string temp = randomColour[num];
