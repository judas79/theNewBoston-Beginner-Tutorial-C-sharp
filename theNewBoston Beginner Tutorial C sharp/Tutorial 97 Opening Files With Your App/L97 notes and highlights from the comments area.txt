For this lesson all we will need is a form1.cs and the program.cs, that should already exist.   We will learn how
to open a file using an app that we create.  We will be able to open a file by right clicking on it, and using the
app we created, to open it.  

First, right click on your windows form1.cs[Design] and choose 'view code'.  In the public form1 constructor, we will
pass a string.  This string will be passed through the app we create to the file we are opening.

		
		public Form1(string s)
        {
            InitializeComponent();
        }


To get to the file that lands up with the string being passed, fromour app, we need to open our program.cs.  Double
click the program.cs so we can see the code.  When we run a program, this is what it looks for first, and runs it.
Program.sc code snippet:

		static void Main()                                         // looks for this then runs, what is below.
        {
            Application.EnableVisualStyles();
            Application.SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefault(false);
            Application.Run(new Form1());                          //  this line creates the form1, when it is run
        }


To move past all the things the code above, including form1, is opening, we will add a string to the void Main().
If we use this, we can pass the string array, to the file we are opening.  For each file we open, we will want
the program.cs to make a form1 for.


		// L97 added a string array to the main to pass to the file being opened
        static void Main(string[] files)  
        {
            Application.EnableVisualStyles();
            Application.SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefault(false);
            // L97 for each file opened, create a form1, and pass in s to form1
            foreach(string s in files)
            Application.Run(new Form1(s));
        }


We will now return to form1 and use a message box to show the path of the file that is being opened by our app., in
a messagebox.

	public partial class Form1 : Form
    {
        // L97 pass in s from Program.cs
        public Form1(string s)
        {
            InitializeComponent();
            // L97 show contnet of s (the file being opened path)
            MessageBox.Show(s);
        }
    }


Now we will switch from debug to release, so we can make an executable in the debug folder, found here, on this:
C:\Users\Roddy\source\repos\theNewBoston Beginner Tutorial C sharp\theNewBoston Beginner Tutorial C sharp\bin\Debug\
It will be a different path on your system, but should be similar, if you can find the repos\ folder.  Copy the *.exe
app. and put it next to a *.txt file, in the folder you use to do your C# testing.  Any folder will due.  
Drag a test .txt file on top of the app you just created.  You should get a messagebox that pops up that has the path
and name to your text file.  After you close the messagebox, a blank for1 should popup.
