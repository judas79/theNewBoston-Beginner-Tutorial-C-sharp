For this lesson we will need button1, 2 trackBar and a 1 NumericUpDown, to learn about thier controls.  Drag 
in a trackBar from the toolbox.  The trackBars Max and Min properties can be set independently in its property
fields.  Click on the trackBar, and change the Maximum to 100 and leave the Minimum at 0.  These can be changed
to whatever the user would like, even negative numbers.  There is also a property to regulate the amount of 
meassurements, there are, between the max and min values.  These are called ticFrequency, and is set to 1, as
a default.  This amount can also be changed and the amount of tics will depend on the amount of the min and
max amounts you set.  If max = 100, min = 0 and ticFrequency = 2, we will have 50 tics;  if our ticFrequency
was 50, we would have 2 tics.
The way it is set now if the user where to drag the slider all the way to the right, it would be 100 and all
the way to the left would be 0.  We will use button1 to display our trackBar value as a string, because it
returns an integer:


		private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            //L108 show messageBox with the trackBar Value
            MessageBox.Show(trackBar1.Value.ToString());
        }


We can also change the trackBars orientation to vertical, by changing its properties. We will also multiply
the values of both of the trackBars, for the hell of it.  We can also change the way the ticks are displayed
using the tickStyle property.  


        private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            //L108 show messageBox with the trackBar Value
            MessageBox.Show(trackBar1.Value.ToString() + " times " + (trackBar2.Value.ToString()));

            // not in lesson muliply trackBar1 value times trackBar2 value
            int mult = (trackBar1.Value) * (trackBar2.Value);
            MessageBox.Show(mult.ToString());
        }


Next we will work on the numericalUpDown, so drag that into your form.  The numericalUpDown is an input that
only accepts numbers.  The black triangle to the right of the box, will go up or down and the number increment
is scaleable.  If you go to the numberUpDown properties, we can change the increment, from its default, 1, to
whatever you desire.  If you change that value, you should also change the maximum and minimum limits, to 
accomedate large increments and decrements.
