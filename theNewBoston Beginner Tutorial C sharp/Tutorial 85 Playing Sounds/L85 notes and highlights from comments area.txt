For this lesson we will need 2 buttons, 1 to play *.wav files and the other to play system sound files.  We will also need:
use System.Media

in our form1, to be able to play the *.wav files.  First create an instance of OpenFileDialog, an a way to verify the user
has  selected a file.


        private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            // L85 create instance of OprnFileDialog
            OpenFileDialog IOFD = new OpenFileDialog();

            // L85 verify that user has selected a file
            if (IOFD.ShowDialog() == System.Windows.Forms.DialogResult.OK) ;
            {

            }
        }


In order to play the file, we will make an instance of SoundPlayer, and have it use the filename we chose, to point to that
file, to play it.  Then we will use the soundplayer instance to play the wave.


			// L85 verify that user has selected a file
            if (IOFD.ShowDialog() == System.Windows.Forms.DialogResult.OK) ;
            {
                // L85 create an instance of Sound player, direct it to use the filename we chose
                SoundPlayer ISB = new SoundPlayer(IOFD.FileName);

                // L85 play the chosen file
                ISB.Play();
            }


Instead of just playing th file once we can have it repeat, and the is playsync, that freezes the app while it plays.

                // L85 repeat the wav
                ISB.PlayLooping();

                // L85 playsync will free the program while it splaying
                //ISB.PlaySync();
