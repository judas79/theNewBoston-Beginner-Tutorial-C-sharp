Change button text by using code.  Double click button, between the brackets type the name, that was givin to the button, the dot '.'
Text.  Hover over the word 'Text' and it will tell you what kind of syntax you need; in this case it is a "string", using double 
quoates.  Also don't forge the equal sign after the word Text. It will only change the Text code one time:

private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            button1.Text = "New Name";
        }

		/* changes button 1 text using button 2, then click button1 to change to another name, then ping pong text, back and forth:

        private void button2_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            int intName = 0;
            button1.Text = intName.ToString();
            intName = (intName++);
        }

You can change other properties, in the same manner, for instance enable or disable, using bool.  We will disable button1 using button 3

private void button3_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            button1.Enabled = false;
        }

Use button 4 to change the height of button1:

private void button4_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            button1.Height = 100;
        }

You can change other properties of other objects.  Add a textbox using the Toolbox, drag and drop.  Highlight it to see
its name in the properties panel.  Also add another button to control the textbox.  To display something in the textbox
using the new button:

 private void button5_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            textBox1.Text = "button5 clicked";
        }

We can change the amount of character typed into the texbox.  We will also use Clear() to delete any text in the textbox.  
Add another button:

private void button6_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            textBox1.Clear();
            textBox1.MaxLength = 4;
        }
