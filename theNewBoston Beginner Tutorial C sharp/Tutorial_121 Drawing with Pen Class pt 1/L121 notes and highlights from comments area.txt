/*
For this lesson we willneed a Panel1.  Select Panel1 an go over into the Event Properties, and double click 
'Click' to create a new  event arguement in our form1 coding area.  The first thing we will do, in the coding 
area, is to create a pen.  We will make a new pen, and in its property field, we will choose the color, that 
our pen will be writing.  Then we will need a shape, to draw  with our pens' color, so we will need to use graphics, 
to create the shape.  We will create the shape on the panel1 surface, with our pen, so instead of using 'fill'
as we did with the solid brush, we will use 'draw' with our pen.  First we will use the Graphics instance, 
'graphicsPn', then the type of object we will be drawing 'DrawRectangle'  Then, for the properties of DrawRectangle,
we will need the new pen variable name we created earlier, then the x,y starting locations, then lastly in pixels, 
the size of the rectangles x,y axis.  Now run debugger and click in the invisible panel area to cause the click
event, to see the graphic.

		private void panel1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {

            // L121 create new pen, it writes is red
            Pen Ppn = new Pen(Color.Red);

            // 121 allow us create graphics on panel1
            Graphics graphicsPn = panel1.CreateGraphics();

            // with Graphics instance drawrectangle
            graphicsPn.DrawRectangle(Ppn, 30, 275, 50, 50);

        }

/*
Next we make the line thicker for our pen tool we created by adding another paramater to our Pen Ppn, after the color
parameter.
Pen Ppn = new Pen(Color.Red,3);

Next, we will draw an ellipse, and a polygon.  They are made exactly the same as the fill paint brush ones we did in
tutorial 120:

            // L121 with Graphics draw an eleipse, on Panel1 stating x,y , dimensions x,y
            graphicsPn.DrawEllipse(Ppn, 100, 275, 50, 75);

            // L121 create point array for polygon, in x,y pairs,
            // staring x,y point, second x,y point, third x,y point
            Point[] PArray2points = { new Point(150, 275), new Point(200, 300), new Point(200, 350) };

            // L121 draw polygon parameters: pen type, then point array
            graphicsPn.DrawPolygon(Ppn, PArray2points);
        }
