For this lesson, we will need button1, textBox1 and a timer, from the toolbox, for a tutorial using the timer class.  The
timer is a background operation and is not a visible item, in form1.  The timer will be in its own box at the bottom of VS,
and its properties accessable on the right, when clicked.  We will first make a crude timer that shows a messagebox, after 
second.  Since the timer doesn't start until the value set as the interval amount of time in milleseconds, is reached, we 
will set the interval in the properties box to 1000 (ms), which is one second.  We will use the start() method, to start the
timer, in button1.  The timer will start, then wait till the second is finished then show message.  Then we will stop the 
timer, so it doesn't continue posting message boxes every second.


        private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            // L84 use start method to start timer which is a tic event
            //Attribute the end of a second, not the beginning of the first (0)second
            timer1.Start();          
        }

The tick event, will trigger the timer1 method, so we will add our message box code to be displayed there, and also to stop
the timer1, so message boxes don't keep poping up every second.  Make sure the timer1.Stop() is before the messagebox, or
it will continue popping up the message and not get to the Stop().


		private void timer1_Tick(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            // L84 stop the timer1, before message, or it will continue looping
            timer1.Stop();

            // L84 show the message after timer stops at 1 second time lapse from the starting point
            MessageBox.Show("1 second has elapsed", timer1.Interval.ToString()+ " millaseconds");      
        }


Next we will create a global int var, to display every second, the count of the timer2, in textBox1, using button2.  So 
drag in timer2 and button2, to your form1.  We will start our timer2, as we did previously, then in the timer2 field, set 
up our variable to display the count number in textBox1.



        // L84 global variable counter
        int iCount = -1;
        private void timer2_Tick(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            // L84 increment count 1 every tick event
            iCount++;

            // L84 show all the numbers, as count is incremented '+='
            // show only the number, that the count is currently on '='
            textBox1.Text = iCount.ToString() + " ";
        }


We also put a timer2 stop in button1, which will stop timer2 as it starts timer1, and does what we set it up to do, earlier.


		private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            // L84 use start method to start timer which is a tic event
            //Attribute the end of a second, not the beginning of the first (0)second
            timer1.Start();

            // button1 will stop timer2 
            timer2.Stop();
        }








*************************** highlights from the comments area **************************






This tutorial is missing loads of vital info. Why didn't you explain the difference between System.Timers.Timer and 
System.Threading.Timer? it's really important. also it's best to programatically implement the event listener as an 
async Task or Action so it doesn't interrupt your main thread. This is a tutorial for NOOBS, if you use timers like this 
for a serious project, your gonna lose your job.





how do i stop the timer from ticking using a button instead of having to hit the stop button in visual studio?

Create button "stop" then in code timer1.Stop();





how to calculate milli and nano seconds?

Nano = 10 at the power of -9
Milli = 10 at the power of -3






create a variable to track a value starting at zero, then for the timer, just do button1.Position.X = yourVariableName * 10;
this will move it 10 pixels each time.
