For this tutorial we need a button1 and label1 to learn about the math, class.  To acces the math class, write math and to access the
methods inside of the math class, a dot, which means the methods are all static.  The first method in the math class we will test and
display using label1, is the absolute value. 

			// L53 Math class type, methods are all static

            // absolute value, method
            label1.Text = Math.Abs(-432).ToString();


The class type math, also contains some values as well as methods, such as PI.

            // value, PI
            //label1.Text = Math.PI.ToString();

The math class also has the power to functionality, for exponential calculations.  The first number in the Pow() field is the number 
you want to use the exponent on, and the second is the exponents value.

			// power to, first is the number, second is the exponent
            label1.Text = Math.Pow(-4,3).ToString();



The Math class, also has the Round method, which will round a decimal point to its nearest whole decimal value, using the default 
setting.  Round can be set to control what point the decimal point is rounded to.  In this example the decimal point is set for hundreds
which is the value, 2.


            // Default, Round decimal point to whole decimal value
            //label1.Text = Math.Round(-23.5).ToString();

            // Round decimal point to nearest specified decimal point value
            // first is number to be altered, 2nd number the place amount to round to
            label1.Text = Math.Round(12.87655, 2).ToString();
