The lesson is taught by Adam, for 'Bucky Roberts', theNewBoston.

First we will download the 2017 Visual Basic Editor:
https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/older-downloads/
You will need to enter you Microsoft email, to download the Visual basic editor, so enter your @outlook.com
email, or create one, for free.

Next launch the Visual Studio installer' you just downloaded, and follow what is says, to install Visual 
Studio.  It will take a while to install.  After you have your main VB and C# files installed click File, New, 
Project, to get to the start page.  Click the link 'open visual studio installer' then add a checkmark to 
download, 'the 'windows form app(.NET Framework) from the list and wait for it to download and install.

Next time, when you open Visual Studio click 'create project' then choose visual c# then select windows form 
app(.NetFramework) and give your app a name then click ok.  A windows form should pop up in the Visual studio
main area, with other files, in the solotions explorer, in the right side window.

If you select the form, you just created, you can click on the toolbox on the left side of the main window, to
see all the tools you can use.  You can collapse all the sub categories of tools and then
expand the top row, to see all windows forms, tools in one list.  You can also click and hold
the toolbox, box, and drag it, halfway down the left window, and dock the tool box there, so
it will remain visible, all the time.

In the right window you can see everything open, in your project as a collasable list, in the
Solution Explorer box.  To see the properties of your form, right click your form and choose 
properties.  A properties box will popup under you solution explorer box. Properties, will
tell you, everything about what your form consists of, and can be tweeked there.




***************************** highlights from the comments area **********************************


c# is better at Object Oriented Programming (ie games for example)
and c++ is better at programs with heavy tasks. 
now i could be completely wrong, so if anyone know better. please correct me,.




C# is C++ and Java put together. C# is easier because there's less you have to do for the same task.





C# is a higher level programming language than C++. This means that there are many objects and interfaces that have already been built for you that you can implement. What is better? This depends on what you are trying to make. I have heard that if you are going to write drivers C and C++ are the way to go. If you are trying to make an application that you can write an essay on, send instant messages or even do simple arithmetic C# is the better language. I would suggest you learn both.






Use Mono, it's a cross-platform framework for many .NET languages including C# :D





C# can only run on Windows? That's totally false. C# can run on Linux or on Mac.

The .NET framework is only for Windows, yes, but C# is not "built on" the .NET framework. It's just that most of the useful classes in the built-in libraries COME from the .NET framework, so without .NET the language is left pretty powerless. However, there are libraries for cross-platform C# development on Mac and Linux. Mono comes to mind.





Is it better to use MonoDevelop or visual studio ?

 MonoDevelop is created using visual studio. Visual studio is the best

The First Coding tool ever exist and the best
is Visual Studio. Without Visual Studio No
Program Can Be Created And We Will All
Die Because Of "Program Starvation". I
Know This Because I just Know it. Windows
10 Is Created in Visual Studio in C#. Visual
Studio Is The The First And Always be The
Best Program To Code A Program Ever.

Yeah, very funny :\. Just stop insulting me

If your computer is slow like mine, maybe you should check out SharpDevelop. Visual Studio is a shameless CPU hog.
