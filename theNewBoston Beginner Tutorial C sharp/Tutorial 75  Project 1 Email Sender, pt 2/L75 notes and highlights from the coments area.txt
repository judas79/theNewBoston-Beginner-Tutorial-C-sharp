In this lesson we will need everything from the last tutorial (tut. 74), to continue building our email sender.  We will
also be using the net and net mail, in our form1.

// L75 net namespace
using System.Net;

// L75 for email
using System.Net.Mail;


Double click the email button on your form, to go in to your button, where we will create an instance of the mail message
class.  We will then handle the from portion of the email, by making IMessage.From equal to any instance of a new instance
of the Mail.Adress class.  The email address used for this will be whatever was entered into textbox4, which ia the email
field, in our form:


        private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            // L75 instance of mail message class
            MailMessage IMessage = new MailMessage();

            // L75 Imessage from, using instance of mail address class 
            // that is entered into the email textbox
            IMessage.From = new MailAddress(textBox4.Text);

        }


We will set the message in the Subject to whatever is entered into textBox2. We will also set our message it the Body, 
to whatever is entered into textBox3.


            // L75 set Subject to message entered text, in textBox2
            IMessage.Subject = (textBox2.Text);
            
            // L75 set Body to message entered text, in textBox3
            IMessage.Body = (textBox3.Text);


Setting up the Recipients, is a little different, because their are multiple address entries, so we have to provide a 
colection.  Since las tutorial, we set a tool popup window, to inform the user to pu a semi-colon between addresses, we
will use 'split' to seperate the adresses from eachother.  We will start with a foreach statement to sepetate the emails
from each other using split.  Then add each IMessage email address To.Add (to address):


			// L75 seperate entered emails from each other using split at char ';'
            foreach (string sAddress in textBox4.Text.Split(';'))
            {
                // adds the split Imessage emails to address 1 at a time
                IMessage.To.Add(sAddress);
            }
        }


In order to send the emails we will need a smpt client;  so we will set that up.  There are also a few properties we will
have to set up, for the client.  The first is the network credentials, which consists of your username and password, in 
that order.  The username and password data will be entered into textbox4 text and textBox5 text, so that is what we will enter as
as far as the pararameters are concerned.


            // L75 setup new smptClient
            SmtpClient smtpClient = new SmtpClient();

            // L75 client credintials properties for the network
            // within parenthesis, username and password,
            smtpClient.Credentials = new NetworkCredential(textBox4.Text, textBox5.Text);


Next we will set up the gmail host service, to send the emails.  This means the user will have to use a gmail client
account email and password fields, to send it.  Other email host services can be added to use other email types; yahoo,
outlook and hotmail for example.  
We will also set up the hosts port, for the SmtpClient to use on 587.
Then to be able to send through gmail we must set enable ssl to true.
And last we will have to provide the message it is to send, which is IMessage


            // L75 setup email host to send (from gmail)
            smtpClient.Host = "smtp.gmail.com";

            // L75 set up hosts port number
            smtpClient.Port = 587;

            // L75 enable SSL for google to send
            smtpClient.EnableSsl = true;

Smtp =
Send mail to people








I think that this doesn't work anymore.
You need to use IMAP protocol.Also you need to enable IMAP in your account settings if it is not enabled by default.

how do i do that exacly?


For those that come here after this post ; 2020 
It worked for me.  I used one of my Gmail addresses to send to another Gmail of mine, with a different address, 
from the same computer, to the same computer.  Haven't tried sending to a remote computer off my home network, 
as of yet.
