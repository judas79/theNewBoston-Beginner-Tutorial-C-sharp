For this lesson we will need 4 buttons, a textBox and a webBrowser, to learn about web Browser control.  We will
start off with naming, our button next to the textBox1, browsers url entry box, 'Go'.  Double click 'Go' (button1),
to go to its coding area.  So we will want to go to the site address, entered in textBox1, when the Go button is
pressed.  We will use the navigate method along with webBrowser1, to accomplish this.


		private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            // L105 navigate method displays page in webBrowser1,
            // after getting address from textBox1
            webBrowser1.Navigate(textBox1.Text);
        }


To have the web address textBox1, display the current webpage address, as the user clicks on links, we will have to
we will have to make an event hadler, to tell us when the address has changed in the webpage address window which is,
textBox1.  To do this select the WebBrowser1 box, then go over to the properties box under the Events tab and double 
click 'Navigated' to create an empty navigate event in form1.  There we will place the address boxes url equal to
the current address that we are at.  For this we will use the webBrowser class to get the current urls address and 
convert that address to a string, for diplaying in textBox1 (url address box).


		private void webBrowser1_Navigated(object sender, WebBrowserNavigatedEventArgs e)
        {
            // L105 webBrowser class get current url converts it to string
            // display url in the webpage address box
            textBox1.Text = webBrowser1.Url.ToString();
        }


Next we will make our, go back, refresh and go forward buttons, functional.  In these buttons we will use the 
webBrowser1 class, to do this.  For the go back button, double click button2 to enter some code.  We use the 
webBrowser1 class and the goback() method.  We use the same class for the refresh() method for the refresh button, 
as well as goforward() for the goforward button, each in its own code area.


        private void button2_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            // L105 go back to the prior web address in your browser, class webBrowser1 goBack method
            webBrowser1.GoBack();
        }

        private void button3_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            // L105 reload the page you are on, class webBrowser1 Refresh method
            webBrowser1.Refresh();
        }

        private void button4_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            // L105 go to the web address you where at before going back in your browser, 
            // class webBrowser1 goBack method
            webBrowser1.GoForward();
        }


Lat we will add a home (button5) to our browser, using the webBrowser1 clas and gohome method.  Since the browser we
created is based on the MS internet explorer browser, the home method will use whatever MS Edge has set for its 
home page.


        private void button5_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            // L105 go to the web address homepage set by the MS browser
            // class webBrowser1 gohome method
            webBrowser1.GoHome();
        }
