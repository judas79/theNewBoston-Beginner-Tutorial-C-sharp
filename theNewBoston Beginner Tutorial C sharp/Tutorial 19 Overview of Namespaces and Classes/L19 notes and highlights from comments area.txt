We will first create a class, by clicking Project, in the main menu, then add class.  We will then rename the namespace within
class from its default, whatever the projects name; it takes as a name, to myNamrespace, for this lesson.  Namespaces are used
for organizing classes, interfaces, and struts.  You can have a namespace within a namespace, as a sub category of the main
namespace.  Within the mySubNamespace we can put, classes, interfaces and struts, as well.

using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

// renamed from theNewBoston_Beginner_Tutorial_C_sharp
namespace myNamespace
{
    // sub namespace
    namespace mySubnamespace
    {

    }
    class myNamespace
    {
    }
}


Classes are used to organize variables, and the methods.  Usually things within a  class work together or close together.  So
things that do similar actions, to each other.  To access the namespace, and thing within it, we need to make a use statement,
at the top where the other use statements are located, to refer to the namespace.

using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using myNamespace:

If we need to use something withing our class myNamespace, and did have a 'use' statement, we woulld have to write out the full
path:

myNamespace.myNamespace. 'whatever else the class method you where trying to access'

Using 'use' statements' save a lot of typing in of the namespace name, before every use of a class.
