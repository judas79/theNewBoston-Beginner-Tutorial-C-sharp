/*
For this lesson, we need the Panel, Pen tool and graphics instance we created last tutorial.  First we will draw an arc.
Arcs are created in a similat way as the fillPie we created in the solidBrush tutorial.  It starts out like the rest
of the shapes with the graphic instance then the draw type arc, then the pen tool name and the x,y starting quardinates.
Next is it size: width by heigth then the starting angle the how many degrees the sweep is.
*/

		private void panel1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {

            // L122 create an arc, parameters (Pen name, starting x,y quardinates, 
            // then the width, and heigth of arc, start angle, sweep angle
            graphicsPn.DrawArc(Ppn, 30, 360, 50, 75, 0, 90);



*/ Next, we will draw a Bezier curve, which is a spline, curve.  This is made out of points, similar to the way our polygons 
where constructed.
Last, we wil draw a line, that consist of our pen, a starting point and a finishing point.  We could not make an array 
work with either of these:
*/


            // L122 draw Bezier, can't use byte array, must have at least 4 points incuding starting point
            graphicsPn.DrawBezier(Ppn, new Point(150, 400), new Point(125, 420), new Point(200, 440), new Point(175, 450));

            // L122 draw a line, parameters: Pen, starting point and and ending p;oint.
            graphicsPn.DrawLine(Ppn, new Point(250, 400), new Point(275, 440));
        }
