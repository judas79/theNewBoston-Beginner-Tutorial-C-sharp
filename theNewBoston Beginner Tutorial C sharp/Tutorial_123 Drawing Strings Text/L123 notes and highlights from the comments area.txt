/*
For this lesson , we will need a Panel1 in form1, to learn about Drawing Strings.  Select Panel1 an go over into
the Event Properties, and double click 'Click' to create a new  event arguement in our form1 coding area.  The 
first thing we will do, in the coding area, is to create a solid brush.  We will make a new solid brush, and in its 
property field we will choose the color, that our brush will be painting.  Then we will need a way to render our string
drawing, with our solid brush color, so we will need to use graphics on panel1, to create the text drawing.  So make 
an instance of Graphics, on panel1.

		private void panel1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)  // all this is already created above
        {
            // L119 create new solid brush, it paints is green
            SolidBrush SB = new SolidBrush(Color.Green);

            // 119 allow us create graphics on panel1
            Graphics G = panel1.CreateGraphics();


/*
Since a string line is being drawn, it cannot be selected, highlighted, copy, or pasted.  Using our graphics class, we 
will implement our draw a string method.  For the DrawLine method parameters, first we will need a text String.  Then
we will need to set up a font type , using the 'using System.Drawing;' so it doens't use the form1 fonts.  For our font
type, we will need an instance of the font family, to use a family name such as "Ariel".  Now that we have our family
font, we can use it as the type family parameter in ouf font type, as well as defining the size of the text, as the second
parameter for the font type instance.
Now we can pass in our font instance, into our DrawLine, as the second parameter.  Then we pass in the solid brush instance,
and the the x, y quardinates for the starting point of our text drawing.

            G.DrawString("This is the end of the drawing lessons", Itrfnt,SB, new PointF(50, 450));

/* We can change the Font Family to "Courier" the size of the text to whatever we want, and FontStyle.  FontStyle are
are things like, underlined, italic, and bold, and we can implement them in our DrawingString FontStyle, as the third 
parameter.

I can also combine the font style
Font font = new System.Drawing.Font(ffamily, 50, FontStyle.Italic | FontStyle.Bold);
