In the previous tutorial, we used the VS editor to design our user interface, and hangmans pole for the Hangman game.  We 
will need all that code to continue our project to draw our head, eyes and mouth.  The first thing we will do, is create an
enumeration to hold a list of all the facial parts, including the head, body and Legs.

/*
Next we will create a method to draw a blue body and all of its parts, with a pen.  We will pass in our enumeration BodyParts, which we will 
name bdprts.  We will use if and if else statements to pass in the bdprts and compare it to see if its in the BodyParts list, as in 
BodyParts.Head, for instance.  Then we will write a couple more if else statements, to do the eyes.  We will have to create a SolidBrush and 
Fill an ellipse, to make the two eyes and mess around with the x y coordinates to get the eyes positioned correctly.  Then we will have to 
draw an arc, using our pen to make the mouth.  You will have to mess with the x y coordinates, but the size should be around 20x20, and start
the arch of the mouth at 45 degrees and wrap that to 90 degrees.

u could have just used switch statement





a "switch" is easier and also faster for the computer i heard
