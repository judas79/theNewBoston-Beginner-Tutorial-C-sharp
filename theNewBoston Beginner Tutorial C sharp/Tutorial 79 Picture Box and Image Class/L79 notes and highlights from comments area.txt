We will need a button1 and pictureBox1, from our toolBox, inside a form1, for this lesson on pictureBox and the image class.  Make
the picturebox, large by pulling out the borders, to size.  We will also change the size mode, of the picturBox, bly clicking on the
small triangle and then picking the centeredImage mode.  The picture will be centered in the image frame, but not resized.  The dotted
lines, that outline the pictureboxes shape, indicate that the pictureboxes borders will not be visible.  To make these borders
visibly outlined, change the border stile, to fixed3D or fixedSingle line.
We will first add a instance to openfile dialog with a way to make sure the user has selected and item. Then the image will be set
in the picturBox, according to the Filename that was chosen.

        private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            // L79 new name instance for openfiledialog
            OpenFileDialog nOFD = new OpenFileDialog();

            // L79 confirm user has selected a file
            if (nOFD.ShowDialog() == System.Windows.Forms.DialogResult.OK)
            {
                // L79 set users selected image using nOFD, to the name that was chosen
                pictureBox1.ImageLocation = nOFD.FileName;
                 // show filepath to image in label1
                label1.Text = nOFD.FileName;
            }


You can also use the Image variable, to create a variable, and open an image, similar to using, 
pictureBox1.ImageLocation = nOFD.FileName;
This method is useful if you want to set the same image in multiple pictureBoxes, or save an 
image for later use.


                // L79 another way to get selected image using nOFD, from the name that was chosen
                Image imPicture = Image.FromFile(nOFD.FileName);

                // L79 display imPicture in pictureBox1 using Image variable
                pictureBox1.Image = imPicture;


We can also set an image from a url, that points to the image, we want.  Drag in another pictureBox,
(pictureBox2), and button2 and we will display the url image there:


        private void button2_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
        // display picture from url in pictureBox2, using ImageLocation and url
        pictureBox2.ImageLocation = "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/co48KphBdiUKP7BbhalRoicXXlVOoBnuO_CYLTYWCJryJOfejoCEtKjb2rqAqEKjpPWUazRWBlEWIacshqQ4LBdfC19kW4yvrcSZovvwyWQCIsgd_mpDjws";
            
        }

how do i save the image filename?


For the 'Johnny come late-lies' like me:

     private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            // L79 new name instance for openfiledialog
            OpenFileDialog nOFD = new OpenFileDialog();

            // L79 confirm user has selected a file
            if (nOFD.ShowDialog() == System.Windows.Forms.DialogResult.OK)
              {        
                // show image file name in label1
                string stImageName = nOFD.SafeFileName;
                label1.Text = stImageName;
            }
        }
