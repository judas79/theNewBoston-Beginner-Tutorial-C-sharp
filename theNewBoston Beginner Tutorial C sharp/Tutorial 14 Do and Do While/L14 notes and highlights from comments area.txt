Create a button1 and a textBox1, for this lesson using while statements.  While statements are conditionsl, so we will first
create a variable int, to use for this purpose.  A while statement is created by first writing: while, then in parenthesis(an
algoryhem to test a condition), then in curly code braces{soemthing you want executed, while the while statement is true}, then
something that changes the context of the condition in the algorythem. Example for button1:

        private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            int i = 0;
			
			// while its true, that i is less than 10
            while (i < 10)
            {
				// the texBox1 will print numbers up to but not including 10
                textBox1.Text += i.ToString();

				// increment i by 1, every cycle as it gets to 10
                i++;
            }

        }


To make a while statement go on forever, and crash the program, you can set while to true:

while(true)


Create button2 and textBox2 to make a do statement.  Do statements loops use a while loop to do the loop at the very end, of 
the statement.  As before, to make an infinite loop, set while(true).  Example of a do statement.

        private void button2_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            // in variable
            int i = 0;
            do
            {
                textBox2.Text += i.ToString();
                ++i;
            }
            while (i < 10);
        }

What's the diference between "=" and "+="?

+= is simply a shortcut. For example if i were to say x = x + 2, a shortcut to that would be x += 2






a += b is the same as a = a+b, it's just a shortcut.






what does he click when it freezes?

You're printing from 0 to 9... How can you print from 9 to 0?? FANX U ALOT DAWG

{
            int i = 10;
            do
            {
                textBox3.Text += i.ToString() + ", ";
                --i;
            }
            while (i >= 0);
        }
