For this lesson all we need is form1, to learn about, ToolStrip and StatusStrip Controls.  From the toolBox, drag a
toolStrip into form1.  The tool strip holds a bunch of options you can use.  For example, the tool bar in VS is a tool-
strip, that contains File, Edit ...+, and all the dropdon menus and options within.
To make our first droptdown button click the black triangle and choose dropdownbutton from the list.  Next we will add
opern and save into our dropdownbutton then start the degugger to see them.

After debugging we will add sub folder options, Save as, and OverWrite, to the Save option, we just created.  Click on
Save, and a place to add Save as and OverWrite, will appear, to enter them in to.

The Icon that represents our DropDown, can be changed to display text, instead.  So if we click it ones, we can go over
to properties and choose DisplayStyle and pick text.  Then we will go to the property, text and change that from 
toolStripDropDownButton1 to file. After debugging, to make sure it all works, we will switch the DiplayStyle to Image 
and Text.

We can also add icons to our sub topics in the drop downs.  First lets go over to:  https://www.iconfinder.com/
and find a free icon for our open button.  We will then put it on the hard drive, somewhere too access it from, the click
on our 'open' dropdown and click once, the go to properties and choose 'image' then navigate to our icon file.  Debug
to test if it works.

Mext we will choose something other than a dropdown; a button, to add to our tool strip.  Next we will change our button
from an image to text in diplayStyle property and change the text property to, 'About'.

Next we will add a comboBox, much like we chose the others, from the toolstrip list.  We can add an option in the combobox
field.  We will add another button so the next item, the separator will stand out better.  We can add seperators to divide 
groups of items up by thier common functionality, and then a split button, to see what it looks like.

Next we will add a statusStrip to our form1, by dragging it in from our toolBox.  Like the other strip tools, it will be
ghostly, and appaear with the others, in the area at the bottom of the page, that you can click to munipulate it in the 
form1.  When clicked, at the bottom of the page, you will see its controls, in the bottom left of form1.  The statusStrip
is used to inform the user of what is going on in the app, as it runs.  So we will choose 'StatusLabel' by selecting it 
after clicking the black triangle, from the list.  We can use this when we are doing something, for example have it print
'opening file' when using the open button.  We added a progressBar also for the hell of it.
