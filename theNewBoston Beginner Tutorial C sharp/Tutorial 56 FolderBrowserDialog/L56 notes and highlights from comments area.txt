All we will need is button1, for lesson on FolderBrowserDialog.  Inside button we will first create an instance of FolderBrowserDialog.
Then we will check if the instance, makes the path to folders.


            // L56 instance of FolderBrowserDialog
            FolderBrowserDialog IFBD = new FolderBrowserDialog();

            // L 56 check 'if' the instance makes the path
            if (IFBD.ShowDialog() == System.Windows.Forms.DialogResult.OK);
            {
                MessageBox.Show("IFBD Functional");
            }


The most import properties you acan use with FolderBrowserDialog is to get the selected path, for display, or other uses.


                // Display the selected pat property
                MessageBox.Show(IFBD.SelectedPath);


You can set FolderBrowserDialog to open a default root folder, meaning any folder you choose to be the folder it starts at, when you
launch, FolderBrowserDialog.  This is also a property of FolderBrowserDialog.  Most of the root folder set, only alow you to choose
that particular set root folder, without browsing to other folders.

            // L56 property to set a determined folder (root folder) for FolderBrowserDialog
            IFBD.RootFolder = Environment.SpecialFolder.UserProfile;


To give a brief description about the root folder area your browser is opening at we use the  description property:


           // L56 set description of the folder root your are opening
            IFBD.Description = "these sub-folders are your only choices";

How can i do it showing the directory in a text box?. Thanks.


FolderBrowserDialog fbd = new FolderBrowserDialog();
            fbd.Description = "Program verilerini nereye kaydetsin?";
            if (fbd.ShowDialog() == System.Windows.Forms.DialogResult.OK)
            {
                textBox1.text = fbd.SelectedPath;
            }







So to save as a varible it would be something like "NewVarible = fbd.SelectedPath" ??? yes I'm in 2020

yes







Here's an updated version: 
OpenFileDialog open = new OpenFileDialog();

            open.Filter = "Image Files(*.jpg; *.jpeg; *.gif; *.bmp)|*.jpg; *.jpeg; *.gif; *.bmp";
            if (open.ShowDialog() == DialogResult.OK)
            {
                lbPath.Text = open.FileName;
            }






there is also the option "shownewfolderbutton" which is very nice cause you can disable that button if you want the user to select a 
existing directory ;)
