/*
For this lesson , we will need a Panel1 in form1, to learn about Drawin Shapes.  Select Panel1 an go over into
the Event Properties, and double click 'Click' to create a new  even arguement in our form1 coding area.  The 
first thing we will do, in the coding area, is to create a brush.  We will make a new solid brush, and in its 
property field we will choose the color, that our brush will be painting.  Then we will need a shape, to fill
in with our solid brush color, so we will need to use graphics, to create the shape.  We will create the shape
on the panel1 surface, they we are going to fill.  For the properties of FillRectangle, we will need the new 
solid paint brush variable name we created earlier, then the x,y starting locations, then lastly in pixels, 
the size of the rectangles x,y axis.  Now run debugger and click in the invisible panel area to cause the click
event, to see the graphic.

		private void panel1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            // L119 create new solid brush, it paints is green
            SolidBrush SB = new SolidBrush(Color.Green);

            // 119 allow us create graphics on panel1
            Graphics G = panel1.CreateGraphics();

            //119 create the fill shape we will paint,
            // first properties option is brushtype, where on x,y axis, then size x,y in pixels
            G.FillRectangle(SB, 20, 20, 150,50)

			// 119 create fill shap elipse
			
        }


/*
Next we will create a file elipse.  The eleipse uses the same properties as a rectangle, so use the same 
format as we did with the rectangle, above.  To make a circle, match the x and y size parameters, in its
properties.
*/


            // 119 create fill shape elipse
            // first properties option is brushtype, where on x,y axis, then size x,y in pixels
            G.FillEllipse(SB, 75, 65, 50, 150);

            // 119 create fill shape elipse (circle)
            // first properties option is brushtype, where on x,y axis, then size x,y in pixels
            G.FillEllipse(SB, 75, 200, 50, 50);
        }
