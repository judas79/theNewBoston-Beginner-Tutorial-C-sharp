For this lesson we will need a textbox1, with vertical scrollbar, and set to multiline = true and a label named status.
We will then need to find a free host site on the web, that we can upload a text file to.  This will be the the text file
we us as our example, to use a webclient to show a static log in out textBox1 window, which we will be able to change,
by writing to our remote text file and saving the content there, on the hosting sites server.
A status log is a way of letting your clients things about your program.  This is a way of ensuring everyone gets the same
content, across the users, that view the log.  Since this log will be on a program, when the clients open it up they will
all see whatever it is that you wrote on the server text document.

We will load the content, when form1 is opened.  Click on form1 properties, then the events tab and double click Load.
We will need to add the 

using System.Net;


to the top of form1, to use this class.  Next in the Load area in form1 we need to create a nesw WebClient class.  Then
we need to access the url from the website that we uploaded the file to and  use our WebClient new class to download the
string, which is the content of our text file, and display it in textBox1.


        private void Form1_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            // L72 create new class of WebClient()
            WebClient cWC = new WebClient();

            // L72 textBox1 to the contents where the DownloadString points you
            textBox1.Text = cWC.DownloadString("https://68ff5456-e6e4-4e8a-bf45-b7914fd680aa.usrfiles.com/ugd/68ff54_e1be3db1a21e40109c3f48cae31f0710.txt");
			//textBox1.Text = cWC.DownloadString("https://pastebin.com/raw/CufQ9tfb");
            
            // start new line for when button1 is clicked
            textBox1.AppendText("" + "\r\n");	
		}

you cant use FTP to access the files? What a crap hoster. All free hosters allow for FTP access.





I had a problem with WebClient, which I fortunately solved. The form took too much time to start (download a string). 
I tried to move the logic to a button and found out that this was only for the first click. The solution was to set 
WebRequest.DefaultWebProxy = null; 
"This occurs because WebRequest by default detects and loads proxy settings the first time it starts".






You can use google drive

How do you use google drive for this? I only manage to get the html of the final link






I recommend using x10hosting. 1GB of storage and a pretty decent amount of bandwidth, can't exactly remember how much 
though. And I know it works with x10hosting's free package because I use it and I can get this to function correctly





If anyone is having problems with using Webs, you can just use Pastebin for strings.

Pastebin worked great. Very easy to use.
