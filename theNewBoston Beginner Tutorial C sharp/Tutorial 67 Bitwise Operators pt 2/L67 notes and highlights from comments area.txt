For this tutorial we will need button1 in form1, and a short(int16) that equals '3' and then we will use the class Convert, to change 
the number to binary then invert (its not) the number, to as many bits comprise its variable, places. To invert the number, we must use 
the invert operator '~' when we define our variable:  short sMyShort = ~3;   
We will use MessageBox to display the results.  We will have to convert I binary short variable to a string to display the binary.  then
in the ToString parenthesis, the variable we are converting and a number pertaining to what base the variable is, in this example, 2.
Since a short is 16 bits, the number 3 in binary 11, would have 14 zeroes in front of
it:  0000000000000011.  After we invert it, it will have 14 ones followed by two 0's:  1111111111111100.  If it where a int it would 
be 30 bits by 2 bits.



            // L66 short var, not it, inverted 
            short sMyShort = ~3;
            // Converts sMyshort binary ',2' to string
            MessageBox.Show(Convert.ToString(sMyShort, 2));
