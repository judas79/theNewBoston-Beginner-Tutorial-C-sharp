We will need everything from the last 3 lessons and a button1 at the bottom of form1, for this tutorial on the ListView
controls.  The first thing we are going to do is add 'Remove selected item' to our context menu.  Do this with the using
the same procedure we did to add get name of item(s) in tutorial 92.  After adding Remove selected item, double click it
to open the form1.cs, so we can enter code in the event handler, for it.  As we did before, we will write an if statement
to insure an item has been selected and not empty.   Then we will remove anything that has been selected using a foreach
loop.


		private void removSelectedItemToolStripMenuItem_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            // L94 insure an items has been selected from the list, not blank space selected
            if (listView1.SelectedItems.Count != 0)
            {
                // L94 go  through every selected item, and remove 
                foreach (ListViewItem ILV in listView1.SelectedItems)
                {
                    ILV.Remove();

                }
            }
        }

Next we will create a method, in the same manner as we just finished doing, to delete all items in the List View.  First
we enter 'Delete all Items' into our context menu, to start creating the method.  Then we will double click delete all
items, to create the event handler in form1.  Then in the Delete all Items, we will enter the following code to do the 
deleting, by clearing all the items in listView1.  This will clear all without having to select them.



		private void deleteAllItemsToolStripMenuItem_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            // L94 clear all items in listview1
            listView1.Items.Clear();
        }


Next we will add checkboxes to our list items.  As the items are entered into out listview, a checkbox next to the item
will not be generated.  After clicking listView, we go over to its properties and select true next to checkbox.  They will
now show the checkboxes and be checkable, but do nothing.  We will add a button to remove the checked items, when the button
is pressed.  We will first make a foreach statement to iterate through items in listview1, then an if statement to remove
the items that are checked, in button2.



		private void button2_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            // L94 iterate through the items in ListView
            foreach (ListViewItem ILV in listView1.Items)
            {
                // L94 if its checked, remove it from the listview
                if(ILV.Checked)ILV.Remove();
            }
        }

Yuo can use this code for removing checked items as well:
foreach (ListViewItem lvi in listView1.CheckedItems)
                lvi.Remove();
At least that works for me :) hope that's usefull
