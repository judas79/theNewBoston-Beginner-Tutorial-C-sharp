All you need is button1 for the lesson on using the Remove and Replace Methods.  First we will create a complete string of text.  Then 
we will usr the Remove method to remove everything but the first work, in the complete string, and use MessageBox to display it:

            // L51 string
            string sCompleteSentence = "John says Hi, and ge Hi";

            // L51 get first word in sentence
            string sRemoveStartSentence = sCompleteSentence.Remove(0 ,5);


Next we will remove everything except, the first 4 characters, by setting the start to 4:
Then as a bonus, we will remove everything but the first and last words.  To count the space, to where you want to set your end point,
depress shift, and starting from the begining, click your arrow button and keep count.  If you put a starting possition offset in,
subtract that from your total count.


            // L51 Get everything but the last 6 characters of the sentence
            string sRemoveEndSentence = sCompleteSentence.Remove(4);

            // NOT IN LESSON omit everything but the first and last word in the example sentence
            string sOmitMiddleSentence = sCompleteSentence.Remove(5, 17);
            

            MessageBox.Show("remove from start, to fifth char.: " + sRemoveStartSentence + ";\nRemove everything to the end, after first 4 chars: " + sRemoveEndSentence + ";\nremove the middle of the sentence: " + sOmitMiddleSentence, "L51 RemoveStart and RemoveEnd");
        


Next we will use the Replace method.  We will replace the string text elements with other string elements.  The string text you want to
replace goes first, withing the replace parenthesis, and the the text you want to replace it with.


            // L51 Replace 1st parameter, text to replace, then, the text you want to use.
            string sReplaceWord = sCompleteSentence.Replace("Hi", "Hello");


Replace all the single element chars with another single element char.  Char elements are in single quoates, and the replacement, order
within the parenthesis is the same as the above example

			// L51 Replace single characters using single quoates
            string sReplaceChar = sCompleteSentence.Replace(' ', '-');


			// NOT IN LESSON Replace empty spaces with -.-
            string sReplaceSpaces = sCompleteSentence.Replace(" ", "-.-");


			// NOT IN LESSON FROM COMMENTS AREA
            string str = "10110101";
            str = str.Substring(0, str.Length - 3) + (char)((((char)str[str.Length - 3] + 1) % '2') + '0') + str.Substring(str.Length - 2, 2);
            MessageBox.Show("was 10110101 now = " + str);

Hello Bucky,
If string, sentence = "10110101".
I need to toggle the 3rd bit/character from the right end.
That implies after = "10110001"
How to do that using Remove and Replace functions?


str = str.Substring(0, str.Length - 3) + (char)((((char)str[str.Length - 3] + 1) % '2') + '0') + str.Substring(str.Length - 2, 2);
