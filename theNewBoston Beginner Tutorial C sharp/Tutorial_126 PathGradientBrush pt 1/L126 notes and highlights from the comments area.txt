/*
For this lesson , we will need a Panel1 in form1, to learn about the PathGradientBrush.  Select Panel1 an go over 
into the Event Properties, and double click 'Click' to create a new  event arguement in our form1 coding area. Then
we will need a way to render our PathGradientBrush, so we will need to use graphics on panel1, to create and render 
the PathGradientBrush.  We will also need the 
"using System.Drawing.Drawing2D;" 
to use the classes and methods in there.  Create an instance PathGradientBrush above the graphics arguement, and for 
the arguements, we are going to need to create a graphicpath instance also.  Create the graphicpath above the Path-
GradientBrush.  For our graphic path, the colors will go from the center out, and be circular.  So we will have to 
create the path for the graphicpath to follow.  To make this we will use our instance of graphicpath 'Igp' and add a
elipse, then fill in the arguements: x/.y starting, and x/y ending coordinates.
Next, for our paintgradiantbrush we will have to make the center color property, for our circular paintgradiantbrush.
Then we will also have to use an array to make the outer surrounding color, for the paintgradiantbrush.
Then last, we have to display the circle on the graphics, and enter the following aruements: 
(brush type, starting point x/y, end point x/y).
