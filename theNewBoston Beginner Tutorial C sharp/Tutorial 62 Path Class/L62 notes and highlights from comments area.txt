For this lesson we will need button1 to learn more about the Path class.  We will need and instance for  OpenFileDialog and
a way to check if the path was correctly implimented and a file chosen to be opened, as we did in the previous tutorial.  Also make 
sure you have using System.IO; in your form1.cs, to access namespace for accessing folders and files.


			// L60 instance of OpenFileDialog
            OpenFileDialog IOFD = new OpenFileDialog();

            // L60 check 'if' the instance makes the path
            if (IOFD.ShowDialog() == System.Windows.Forms.DialogResult.OK)
            {
                MessageBox.Show("IOFD Functional, file selected");

            }


We will first examine the Path class, GetDirectoryName method, which will get the path to the directory in which the file you choose
is in.  Then we will use an identical mehtod to get the Extension of the file.


                // L62 Path class, get directory path of the IOFD chosen FileName
                // display with messagebox
                MessageBox.Show(Path.GetDirectoryName(IOFD.FileName), "Path.GetDirectoryName");

                // 62 Path GetExtension of the file we choose, and display with messagebox
                MessageBox.Show(Path.GetExtension(IOFD.FileName), "Path.GetExtension");
            }



The Path class, GetFileName, will get the name and its extension, using the same layout for the method, above. Then we will also Get 
the filename without the extension:

				// 62 Path GetFileName and extension of the file we choose, and display with messagebox
                MessageBox.Show(Path.GetFileName(IOFD.FileName), "Path.GetFileName with Extension");


				// 62 Path GetFileName without the extension of the file we choose, and display with messagebox
                MessageBox.Show(Path.GetFileNameWithoutExtension(IOFD.FileName), "Path.GetFileNameWithoutExtension");



Next we will GetFullPath, which gets the path including the filename and extension.  We will also simply show the instance of the Open
Dialog we made, that will display the same conten as the GetFullPath does; redundant:


				// 62 Path GetFullPath, get path, file and extension of the file we choose, and display with messagebox
                MessageBox.Show(Path.GetFullPath(IOFD.FileName), "Path.GetExtension");

                // 62 Show IOFD.FileName, get path, file and extension of the file we choose, and display with messagebox
                MessageBox.Show(IOFD.FileName, "Show IOFD.FileName");




The final Path class method is the, HasExtension, which checks and returns a boolean true/ false; so we will need to use ToString(),
to display it in messagebox.



                // 62 Show IOFD.FileName, get path, file and extension of the file we choose, and display with messagebox
                MessageBox.Show(Path.HasExtension(IOFD.FileName).ToString(), "Path.HasExtension");

Hay
The get gull path is very useful is you have a relative path and you need to get the full path 
I have used it alot
