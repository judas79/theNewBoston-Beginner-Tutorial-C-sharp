For this lesson we will need button1 to learn more about the Process class.  We will need and instance for  OpenFileDialog and
a way to check if the path was correctly implimented and a file chosen to be opened, as we did in the previous tutorial.  Also make 
sure you have using System.Diagnostics; in your form1.cs, to access namespace for accessing folders and files.

// added L63
using System.Diagnostics;

		private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
		{
			// L60 instance of OpenFileDialog
            OpenFileDialog IOFD = new OpenFileDialog();

            // L60 check 'if' the instance makes the path
            if (IOFD.ShowDialog() == System.Windows.Forms.DialogResult.OK)
            {
                MessageBox.Show("IOFD Functional, file selected");

            }


The first method we will examine in the Process class, is Start.  We will use an instance of OpenFileDialog to select a file then the 
Start method will execute the exe file.  Shortcuts will not function as desired, using this method and will return an error.


				// L62 proccess class, start method, 
                // browse to using instance IOFD and start an executable
                MessageBox.Show(Process.Start(IOFD.FileName).ToString(), "Process.Start");



For some executables (located in the system32 folder)you don't need a path to them, for instance notepad.exe.  We can simply add the 
name of the executable to our Start method:


			// L62 process class, Start method, launch notepad.exe, cmd.exe
            //Process.Start("notepad.exe");
            Process.Start("cmd.exe");



Next we will use the GetCurrentProcess, to display, what process we are using, and display it in messagbox, using the .ProcessName method.
if you look in Task Manager, in a sub category of VS, you will see the same proccess, in there, running.


				// L62 Process class, GetCurrentProcess method, Get ProcessName
                MessageBox.Show(Process.GetCurrentProcess().ProcessName);




The last Process class we will look at, in this lesson is the Process.GetCurrentProcess(). method using Kill to close the process.



                // L62 Process class, GetCurrentProcess method, Kill
                Process.GetCurrentProcess().Kill();
