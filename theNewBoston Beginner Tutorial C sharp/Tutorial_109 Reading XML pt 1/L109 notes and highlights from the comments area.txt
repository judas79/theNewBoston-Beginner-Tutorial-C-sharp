We will need a button and to download 'notepad++' for this lesson on reading XTML.  XTML is basically a way of
storing data and is very similar to treeView, in VS.  Like treeView it stores nodes of data within nodes.  The
way we create an XTML node is a less than sign, then the name of the node followed by a greater than sign.  This
will be the begining point of the node.
<node>

Then end node is similar but has a forward slash in it, the name is the same.
</node>

The first thing we will do is make up an xml document to experiment with.  In notepad++ make a document like this
and save as an .xml.

<People>
	<Person>
		<Name>Roddy</Name>
		<Age>44</Age>
		<Email>robotrods@gmail.com</Email>
	</Person>
</People>


We will also need:
using System.Xml;
to work with xml files, at the top of our form1.
We will first use button1, in our form to open a file, and verify that the user has indeed, chosen one.  We will
also make a filter, so we only can open xml files.  Then we will make an instance of the xmlDocument class and
use the load method to open our xml document.  Finally we will use SelectSingleNode to read the contents of our
<Name> node in our Ixml.  We recreate our path for this by using forward lines, instead of the greater and lesser
than symbols, used in xml:

<People>
	<Person>
		<Name>Roddy</Name>

path will look like this:   People/Person/Name

We will pass that path into our SelectSingleNode method, and the use the innerText property to get the Name:



        private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            // L109 open file dialog to select xml file
            OpenFileDialog Iofd = new OpenFileDialog();

            // L109 filter to only open xml file
            Iofd.Filter = "XML|*.xml";
            if(Iofd.ShowDialog() == DialogResult.OK)
            {
                // L109 make instance of xmlDocument class
                XmlDocument Ixmld = new XmlDocument();

                // L109 us load method to open, passed in, filename or url
                Ixmld.Load(Iofd.FileName);

                // L109 read the contents of a single line in the file
                // the path to name is "People/Person/name, diplayed in messageBox
                MessageBox.Show(Ixmld.SelectSingleNode("People/Person/Name").InnerText);
            }
