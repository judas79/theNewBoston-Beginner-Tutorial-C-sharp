For this lesson, we will need all the code and form1, from the two prior lessons, for this tutorials, further exploration
of listView controls.  Controls collection on each Form instance—lets you access all the items such as TextBox, Button 
and more in a unified way.  Since we will be working with multiple items, click the listView box and make sure multiSelect
is set to true.  Also, click the contextMenuStrip1 and add an (s) in parethesis to the 'Get Name of Item' so it reads;
'Get Name of Item(s)', since we will be working with multiple selected items.  Run the debugger and verify that you can
add multiple entries and are able to select them using ctrl in the context box.
As of now we are only set up to get the first item in the listView, even if we select two items.  If we want to only get
the second item in list view, we would change the code fron:
MessageBox.Show(listView1.SelectedItems[0].SubItems[0].Text);
to:
MessageBox.Show(listView1.SelectedItems[1].SubItems[0].Text);
to get the second chosen items[1] in the lists, and its name[0], value.
So, to get all the selected items, we will loop through the selcted items.  Then another loop get all the data in the 
sub items, which are the name, age and email.



 private void getNameOfItemToolStripMenuItem_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            // L92 insure an items has been selected from the list, not blank space selected
            if(listView1.SelectedItems.Count != 0)
            {
                // L93 loop though all the selected items in listView1, for the data within
                foreach (ListViewItem ILV in listView1.SelectedItems)
                {
                    // loop through all the selected items to  get
                    // all the data in all the sub items (name, age, email)
                    int count = listView1.SelectedItems.Count;
                    for (int i = 0; i < count; i++)
                    {
                        MessageBox.Show(ILV.SubItems[i].Text);
                    }
                    


If we only wanted to get the age from the sub-items we could use, a static number to point to the array item, instead of
the variable i, which will get the total count of all the sub items.


		private void getNameOfItemToolStripMenuItem_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            // L92 insure an items has been selected from the list, not blank space selected
            if(listView1.SelectedItems.Count != 0)
            {
                // L93 loop though all the selected items in listView1, for the data within
                foreach (ListViewItem ILV in listView1.SelectedItems)
                {
					// Get age only of selected items
					//MessageBox.Show(ILV.SubItems[1].Text);
				}
