For this lesson we will need button1, drag in an imageList from our ToolBox and some 20x20 png images from the internet,
to further learn the treeView controls.  After we draf in our imageList, click on it once; it will be where the other
hidden tools go, at the bottom of VS.  Go into the imageList properties, by right clicking 'imageList' at the bottom,
and navigate to the image files you downloaded, in the images (collection) property, and add them to that list, then
press ok.

Next click your button1, so we can write some code, in the button area.  We will now make a new treeNode, as we did
with instances, in other lessons.  Then we will set some text to the treenode name we just made.  Then we will set
the imageIndex number to the image we put, in our imageList.  To do this go into your imageList1 properties and in
the images (coleection) box, and choose the number next to the image, you added their, that corresponds to the text
you just set.  After that, we will click in the treeView1 box to look into its properties.  In the imageList property
within treeView1, choose imageList1, to be able to display the images in treeview.

		private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            // L101 create new treeNode;
            TreeNode Itn0 = new TreeNode();
            // set text in Node 0 to Person
            Itn0.Text = "People";
            // set image index to number in imagelist index #
            Itn0.ImageIndex = 3;
            // pass the tree node to treeView1
            treeView1.Nodes.Add(Itn0);
		}


You will notice there is already a checkbox provided, that we didn't add ourselves;  I don't know why... 
If you noticed, when you select the node, we just made, it changes the image.  We will have to also set up the selected
image to look the same as the image, when its not selected.  The default setting for this is index image [0].

			// make selected image the same as the unselected image
            Itn0.SelectedImageIndex = 3;


Next we will copy paste what we just finished, and chane the values, to create another treeNode.

			// L101 Another treeNode
            // L101 create new treeNode;
            TreeNode Itn1 = new TreeNode();
            // set text in Node 0 to Person
            Itn1.Text = "Animals";
            // set image index to number in imagelist index #
            Itn1.ImageIndex = 0;
            // pass the tree node to treeView1
            treeView1.Nodes.Add(Itn1);
            // make selected image the same as the unselected image
            Itn1.SelectedImageIndex = 0;


Last, we will make a sub treeNode under the Animals treeNode.  As we did in tutorial 100, we will have to use sub
Nodes, to do this.  Since Animals is the second node, its index number is [1], and People, the first node is index 
[0].  So we add insects to index [1].


			// L101 sub node insects, for animals
            // L101 create new treeNode;
            TreeNode Itn2 = new TreeNode();
            // set text in Node 0 to Animal
            Itn2.Text = "Insects";
            // set image index to number in imagelist index #
            Itn2.ImageIndex = 2;
            // pass the tree node to treeView1, to make sub node
            treeView1.Nodes[1].Nodes.Add(Itn2);
            // make selected image the same as the unselected image
            Itn2.SelectedImageIndex = 2;


To be thorough, we will add a sub node to the insects sub node.  So, Animals is at index [1], and since insects
are at the first level of Animals, we will write it aas follows to add dragon flys to the sub index, insects:


			// L101 sub node dragonfly, for insects
            // L101 create new treeNode;
            TreeNode Itn3 = new TreeNode();
            // set text in Node 0 to Animal
            Itn3.Text = "Insects";
            // set image index to number in imagelist index #
            Itn3.ImageIndex = 1;

            // pass the tree node to treeView1, Animals at [1], insects at [0]
            treeView1.Nodes[1].Nodes[0].Nodes.Add(Itn3);

            // make selected image the same as the unselected image
            Itn2.SelectedImageIndex = 1;
