For this lesson we will need 2 buttons, 1 textbox and a webBrowser for part 3 of our webBrowser control tutorial.
In this lesson we will load yahoo, then use are webBrowser app, to enter the text, from our textBox1, into the 
yahoo searchbox then use our button click, as an event to click yahoo's search button.  
First, we will enter www.yahoo.com in out webBrowser properties, URL.  We had to change to a non java site, for this code to
perform correctly, so we swithed to https://duckduckgo.com/ instead of  the yahoo site.  If we debug, it should now automatically
load https://duckduckgo.com/.
The next thing we will do is put text inside the yahoo text element (searchbox), using out text.Box1 to do it.
We will use Document.GetElementById to use our textBox, initiated by the event of clicking button1.  So first
we have to get https://duckduckgo.com/ searchbox id, by opening thier website to the main page, using google
chrome, then right clicking on the searchbox and choosing 'inspect' from the context menu.  Hihglight the ID
information, ie 'ID='; what is after the = sign, and copy it.  Now we will paste that in our Document.GetElementById
line of code.



		private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            // L106 send text from textbox1 into duck&Go's search box
            // Documents properties, .GetElementById method, id value from ducduckgo, use main text or childs text, 
            // set value entered in textbox1 intto  duckduckgo's searchbox
            webBrowser1.Document.GetElementById("search_form_input_homepage").InnerText = textBox1.Text;
        }
    }


Next we will have our button2 click the search button on duckduckgo's website, when our button is pressed.
To do this, we will use the search buttons id, on the duckduckgo site as we did before to use the id to invoke
that button to click when we press our button2.

		private void button2_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            // L106 activate duck&Go's search box button, when are button is pressed
            // Documents properties, .GetElementById method, id value from ducduckgo, use main text or childs text, 
            // invoke the duckduckgo search to click when the click event is initiated in our app
            webBrowser1.Document.GetElementById("search_button_homepage").InvokeMember("Click");
        }



Most if not all search buttons InvokeMember is the word "Click".  To verify that it is Click, we right click
the search button on duckduckgo and choose 'inspect', then after google chromes editor loads, we click on 
the scripts tab and search for "Click".  You will see it listed along with others.
