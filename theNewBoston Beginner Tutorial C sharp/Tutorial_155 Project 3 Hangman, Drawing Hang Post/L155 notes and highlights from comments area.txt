/*
In the previous tutorial, we used the VS editor to design our user interface for the Hangman game.  In this lesson we will
need everything from the previous lesson, to make the hangman scaffolding structure for the gallow, for the hangman game.
First we will right click on our form1 and choose to <> view code in are coding area.

Here we will create the means to view our gallow structure, using an instance of graphics in our Panel, in groupBox1.  We 
use a brown pen to draw lines that are 5 pixels wide.  Lookin at our size of the panel, we will notice that it furthist
point for the x 203, y 300, so we will build our structure from the bottom up, starting at the ground, which is 300.

So first lets create a method named drawHangPost in the , to draw our gallows post in form1.  We will then CreateGraphics
in our panel1 and set the name of this instance to 'gr'.  Since we are drawing lines only, we will create a brown pen that
draws a line 10 pixels wide.

We will start our line at the bottom of the panel 300 and about 20 in from the x axis, which is 203.  So we will use graphics
to draw a line, at the bottom as the base, using our pen at starting Point 157, 300 to the bottom most point of x,y.  Then in
the center of that, we will draw our vertical post.  Notice we overlay the base and post, as not to form gaps.  Remember the 
line width is 10 so you will need to be at least 5 pixels in to oviod gaps.  Next we will draw the horizontal top for our
gallow, then finally the vertical hanging overlay.

Graphics g = panel1.CreateGraphics();
            Pen p = new Pen(Color.Brown, 10);
            g-DrawLine(p, new Point(130, 220), new Point(150, 5));
            g-DrawLine(p, new Point(135, 5), new Point(150, 5));
            g-DrawLine(p, new Point(60, 0), new Point(150, 5));

What's wrong? Im getting a Error that says "Only assignment, call, increment, decrment, and new object expressions can be 
used as a statement." 



for people that may come here in the future.  It seems to be that you used a hyphen instead of a period.
 g-DrawLine(p, new Point(60, 0), new Point(150, 5));     
// should be:
 g.DrawLine(p, new Point(60, 0), new Point(150, 5));






 you shold give names to your controls....if you will make something big by time even you forget which one is panel 1 etc.
 but good tut





The code doesnt work unless I offset the point by 1 pixel e.g. g.DrawLine(p, new Point(130, 218), new Point(131, 5));

But Ive got a working code, remove the DrawHangPost() method and Form1_Shown event and use (with ur coordinates):

private void Form1_Paint(object sender, PaintEventArgs e)
        {
            Graphics g = panel1.CreateGraphics();
            Pen p = new Pen(Color.Black, 5);
            g.DrawLine(p, new Point(130, 220), new Point(130, 5));
            g.DrawLine(p, new Point(133, 5), new Point(60, 5));
            g.DrawLine(p, new Point(60, 3), new Point(60, 40));
        }

Then link this to the your form by going Properties of your form, then Events then Paint and select the new method Form1_Paint
