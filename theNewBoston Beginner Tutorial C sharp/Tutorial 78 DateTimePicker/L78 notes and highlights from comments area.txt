For this lesson we will need a button1 and a DateTimePicker.  The datetimepicker default, only displays day of the week and the 
current Date.  After starting debugging, the user can click the upside down triangle, on the datetimepicker, to choose the day, month,
and year, and change them there.  In order to see the time, click the datetimepicker, and go over to the properies box, and look 
for the 'format' section.  Long is what you see as the default, short will display the date like '1/2/1999', Time display only the
time 12:33:12 PM and Custom.
When set to the Custom property, the user will have to enter the custom values, that the user wants to include in the DateTimePicker.
There is a list online that shows the different ones that can be used here:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.datetimepicker.customformat?view=netcore-3.1
Try different ones in the Properties Format Custom space to enter the values. You can add symbols between the values, from the chart,
such as H:m:s, to customize it the way you like.  You can also change the fonts or colors of the calender, in properties as well.

To get what the user has selected, in the datetimepicker, we will go to button1, and add the following to get the date and time from
the picker:


        private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            // L78 Get the values from datetimepicker (date and time)
            DateTime dDT = dateTimePicker1.Value;
            MessageBox.Show(dDT.ToString());
        }
