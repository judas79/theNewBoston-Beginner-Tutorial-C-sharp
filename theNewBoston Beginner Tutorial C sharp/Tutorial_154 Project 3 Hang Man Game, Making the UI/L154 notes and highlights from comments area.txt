In this multipart project tutorial, we will need many components and they will need explanations, of their placements, within
form1.  At the end of the project, we should have a working hang man game.  The first 3 items, we will place, in our form1, are
groupBoxes.  We will put one on the right side, and we will delete the text for the groupBox name.  Then we will put another
groupBox, from the top left and span to the edge of the first groupbos we created, also deleting the name text.  Then we will
place the third groupBox under the 2nd groupbox, also deleting its name.  The far right groupbox will contain the actual hang-
man, the second groupBox, will be where the underline letters of the word and how many characters long the word is, will be displayed 
and the third groupBox where the buttons to submit a letter, or the entire word, will be.  See included image.

In the first groupBox, where the hangman is displayed, we will drag a 'panel' into it filling the entire groupBox.  We will
use the panel to display our hangman.  You can do this by clicking the panels black triangle and chooseing 'Dock in parent
container.  
Jumping over to the 3rd groupBox, we will add a button, on the far left side, and name its Text 'Submit Letter'.  That's what it 
will be used for, by the user.  To the right, of the button drag in a textBox and resize it small.  In the properties, for the
textBox, set the maxLength to 1, as to hold only 1 letter.  Then next to that textBox add another button and name its Text Submit
Word.  Next to that button, drag in another textBox and leave the maxSize alone, for this one.

Now we will move to the 2nd groupBox area and add a label, on the right buttom of the group, to display the fact that a value
of the amount characters, that are in the word, being guessed about.  We will name that label Text, Word Length.

Last we will rename our form1 Text, to HangMan - <your name>... whatever yur name is.  We will also set the form1 properties to 
false for, MaximumBox and, FormBorderStyle to FixedSingle.
