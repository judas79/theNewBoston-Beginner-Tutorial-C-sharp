For this tutorial add a button to a windows form.  Double click the button and you should have this:

using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.ComponentModel;
using System.Data;
using System.Drawing;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using System.Windows.Forms;

namespace theNewBoston_Csharp_Beginner_Tutorial.Tutorial_03
{
    public partial class Form1 : Form
    {
        public Form1()
        {
            InitializeComponent();
        }

        private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {

        }
    }
}

What ever we do between the brackets, will pertain to the button:

private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
			/* This is where you type your code for the button
        }

We will type some code in between these brackets to launch a message box:

private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
			/* This is where you type your code for the button
        }

Write the code to call the message box then a dot then Show to show the message then within parenthesis and each word in double 
quoates, not single quoates'you will get an error', type the text you want to appear, then separated by a coma, the title of the 
message box, that will appear at the top of the message  box:

		{
            MessageBox.Show("Statement", "MyTitle");
        }

You will notice the code is auto completed in a box that pops up when you are typing code.  Its called a IntelliSense suggestions
box.  It will give you the possibilities of code you can enter next.
Next we will add a message that pops up when you hover over the button. While the button is in a selected state, right click and
choose properties, and the properties box will popup on the right side of the screen.  Click the lightening bolt (events) icon.
Go down the list a click 'mouseHover' and generated code for its class should popup on the screen, for you to enter the code you 
would like it to execute when you hover over the button.
