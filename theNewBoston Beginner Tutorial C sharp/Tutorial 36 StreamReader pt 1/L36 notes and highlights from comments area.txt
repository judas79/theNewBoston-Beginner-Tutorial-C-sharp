In this lesson we will need a button1 and a textbox1, to learn about the StreamReader class.  In the form1 area we need to access the
StreamReader class library through its namespace which is system.io.  So at the top add the access to its namespace so we can create
an instance of it.

// added L36 for StreamReader
using System.IO;


First we will make an instance of the OpenFile Dialog, and an if statement to help create the stramReader instance. To create the 
instance we will assign sr to opening a (stream); file to read, while creating the instance, which is a neccessary and expected.  
Within the parenthesis we tell the compiler its a File that we want to open and read.  Then we use the instance of the OpenFileDialog 
to use its class FileName to get our file.  (Personal note) I think we could also use a static path there instead, if we wanted.

 
            // L36 instanc of openfildialog
            OpenFileDialog ofd = new OpenFileDialog();

            if (ofd.ShowDialog() == System.Windows.Forms.DialogResult.OK)
            {
                // create instance of streamReader, and give it a file to openread, 
                //  using a (path) or useing ofd to access the openfiledialog class filename
                StreamReader sr = new StreamReader(File.OpenRead(ofd.FileName));
            }


Now that we have the 'stream' set up we will use the ReadEnd method to read all of the Text, until the end of the document, the 
display the text in textBox1 window.

				// to read a streams text file, ReadToEnd method 
                // sr.ReadToEnd();
                // to read all the Text file into a textbox1
                textBox1.Text += sr.ReadToEnd();


In order not to accidently making two instance the open the same files we use dispose to shut down the 'stream' for the particular file
and close it properly, to avoid an error:

				// dispose of the 'stream' used to get this file
                sr.Dispose();


Now download a hexadecimal reader, and look at your text file you opened.  That's what the next lesson will be about; reading bytes:
