In this project, we will be making an Address Book.  In this first of seven parts, we will set up the user interface.  We will need many
components:

1 create a form1 and name Text: Address Book.
2 Drag in a groupBox put it on the left hand side of form1 and name Text: People
3 Drag in a listView, and put into the groupBox and dock it, if you want
4 Drag in another groupBox, put it on the right side of form1, name Text: Information

This is where the next items will all go into, that hold the information about the people heading in the first groupBox.  Most of these,
items, will consist of a label, followed by a textBox.

5 Drag in a label, name Text: Full Name
6 Drag in a textBox and set it to the right of the Full Name label, and stretch the box to the end of the 'Information" groupBox

Next we will copy both the label and textBox, and paste two copies below it.

7 Name this next label Text: Email Address
8 Name this next label Text: Street Address
9 Name this next label Text: Phone #...........This is optional NOT in the lesson

10 Drag in a label and name Text: Birthday
11 Drag in a DateTimPicker and resize it to the size of your textBoxes
12 Drag in a label and name Text Additional Notes.  This will be on its own line.  Then below it, will be a textBox that takes up the almost
the entire bottom of the information groupBox.  Leaving room for 3 side by side buttons

13 Drag in a textBox and fill the bottom area leaving enough room for three buttons, in the information groupBox.  Check multiLine to adjust
   the textBox.

Select the entire groupBox and move it around until it looks centered, if you need to.

14 Drag in a button and add it to the bottom left of our ifnormation groupbox.  This will be for saving, so name Text Save Changes.
15 Copy Paste our Save Changes button, and call the name Text the first: Add Contact.
16 Past another button a name Text: Remove

17 Next we will drag a contextMenustrip into our listView in the People groupBox, so we can add and remove contacts.  We will add 'Remove'
   to our contextMenuStrip in the dropdown.

Last, we will go into our form1 properties and change are FormBorderStyle to FixedSingle.  We will also set our MaximizeBox to False, so
the user can not change the dimmensions of our app.
