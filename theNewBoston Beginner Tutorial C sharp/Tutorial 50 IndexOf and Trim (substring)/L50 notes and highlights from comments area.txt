All we'll need for this lesson is button1, to use index of string in our substring.  Instead of getting our information from a string,
by making a substring, to get the starting point, then the amount of characters we want, we will use the starting point, then the space
between the first name and last name, to isolate the characters wee want.  So continuing on from last lesson:


			// L49 string
            string sFullName = "John Smith";


to get the first name from our string we use our starting point as 0 and end point is the empty space;  IndexOf(' ') from the originsl
string sFullName.
To use this principle to get the last name, we use the blank space index point as the start of the substring read, that will go to the 
end.  No need for the second component for the substring.


			// L50 using index of string, and starting point to get substring characters, last name
            string sIndexFirstName = sFullName.Substring(0, sFullName.IndexOf(' '));


            // using index of string, and index (empty space) as the starting point, 
            // to get substring characters to the end, last name
            string sIndexLastName = sFullName.Substring(sFullName.IndexOf(' '));


If you will notice after compiling it, the last name has a space before it.  That is because when we our doing our indexof parcing, it
pacrces before the space.  To remedy this we add 1.

			string sIndexLastName = sFullName.Substring(sFullName.IndexOf(' ') + 1);

			


Next we will use the trim operator, to get rid of unwanted spaces, that may be at the beginning and at the end of character, that you
want to save string.  Notice, Trim is not a substring method.

			// L50 use trim default to get rid of spaces at beginning and end of string

            // string 2
            string sFullNameSpaces = "      Mike Jones    ";
            string sTrimedFullName = sFullNameSpaces.Trim();

            MessageBox.Show("last name: " + sIndexLastName + ",\nfirst name: " + sIndexFirstName + ",\ntrimmed name: " + sTrimedFullName, "Tutorial 50");


We can also use TrimStart to get rid of, only the spaces at the beginning and TrimEnd, to get rid of spaces only at the end.

            // L50 TrimStart, get rid of empty spaces at the begining, before the characters
            string sTrimStartName = sFullNameSpaces.TrimStart();

            // L50 TrimEnd, get rid of empty spaces at the end, after the characters
            string sTrimEndName = sFullNameSpaces.TrimEnd();

            MessageBox.Show("Trim Start name: " + sTrimStartName + ";\ntrim end name: " + sTrimEndName, "L50 TrimStart and TrimEnd");
