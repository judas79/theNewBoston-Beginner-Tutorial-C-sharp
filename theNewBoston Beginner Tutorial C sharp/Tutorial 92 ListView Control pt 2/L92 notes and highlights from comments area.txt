We will need the form1.cs and all its content, from tutorial 91 (prior lesson).  We will start this lesson by dragging
a context menu, into the form1, from the toolBox.  A context menu, is a box that pops up when your right click on an item
in Windows, that contains a bunch of options or properties.  The context menu we are addding, will be one of those invisible
items, that you can see listed, where the timers, where located, in a prior lesson; at the bottom of the page.  Drag in
the contexMenuStrip from the toolbox.  You will see a ghostly image of it on your form towards the top left corner.  We
will use this context menu to select (right click on items), within our listView. 
To use this context menu, type this in the space, at the top of the ghostly contex menu:

Get Name of Item

Then in the form1 double click the ListView box, so its properties show at the right of VS, and choose contextMenu1, from
the contextMenu property.  Now we can run debug.  In debug mode right click in the listView window, and see if 
"Get Name of Item", that we created earlier, pops up.
Next, we will click at the bottom of the screen, when we are in the form1.cs[Design], where it say "ContextMenuStrip1",
once, so that the ghostly ContextMenuStrip appears in ou form1.  Double click the Ghostly contextmeustrip 
'Get Name of Item'so we can add some code to be executed when someone clicks in the context menu Get Name of Item, area
it will be run, and something will happen.
We will create an if statement to insure that an item has been selected from the viewList.  Next we will create a way
to view the data, of the selected item, from within the listview, by using its index number, to point to it, in the list.
Zero, is always the first index number in a ListView and we will use it as an array and save the info as a collection.
We will do the same for the sub-selections, which consist of 0-2, for the name, age and email.



		private void getNameOfItemToolStripMenuItem_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            // L92 insure an items has been selected from the list, not blank space selected
            if(listView1.SelectedItems.Count != 0)
            {
                // L92 choose main list selected item using index #,
                // choose the first list item in sub selection (name), using context menu
                MessageBox.Show(listView1.SelectedItems[0].SubItems[0].Text);

                // get second item in sub list (age), using context menu
                MessageBox.Show(listView1.SelectedItems[0].SubItems[1].Text);

                // get third item in sub list using context menu (email)
                MessageBox.Show(listView1.SelectedItems[0].SubItems[2].Text);
            }
