/*
For this lesson , we will need a Panel1 in form1, to learn about Drawing Strings.  Select Panel1 an go over into
the Event Properties, and double click 'Click' to create a new  event arguement in our form1 coding area. Then we 
will need a way to render our LinearGradientBrush, so we will need to use graphics on panel1, to create and render 
the LinearGradientBrush.  We will also need the "using System.Drawing.Drawing2D;" to use the classes and methods in
there.  Create an instance LinearGradientBrush, and then enter the following aruements: (starting point x/y, end
point x/y, starting color, ending color).  After that we will create the shape, a fillrectangle, to render the 
gradiant in.  The FillRectangle is initiated with the graphic we made and the uses the arguements: the instance of
LinearGradientBrush 'Ilgb' then the starting point of the gradient rectangle, then the coordinates of the end of 
that filled rectangle.

		private void panel1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            // L124 create instance of with arguements: starting point x/y, end point x/y, starting color, ending color
            LinearGradientBrush Ilgb = new LinearGradientBrush(new Point(20, 20), new Point(20, 70), Color.Red, Color.Yellow);

            // L124 create graphics on panel1
            Graphics Ig = panel1.CreateGraphics();

            // L124 render graphic of the gradiant within a gill rectangle arguments: 
            // instance ofLinearGradientBrush, starting point of rectangle, ending point of the rectangel
            Ig.FillRectangle(Ilgb, 20, 20, 50, 50);


/*
We can also make a circle using FillSphere, with the same arguements we used for the FillRectangle
*/

			// L124 make a circle using FillSphere arguements:
            // instance ofLinearGradientBrush, starting point of fill elipse, ending point of the Elipse
            Ig.FillEllipse(Ilgb, 170, 60, 170, 60);
        }
