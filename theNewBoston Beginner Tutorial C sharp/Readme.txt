These are my notes and files, from the 200 or so tutorials, taught by Adam on thenewboston(s) channel, starting at this address, on
youtube:

The notes and comments, including comments in the code, will have gramatical errors.  The code, should almost all be correct, as I used
VS 2017 community and debugged throughout the lessons, except for tutorial 139, which I will review, one day.  

That said, my understanding of the concepts may be in error also, as I was learning this, without any prior knowledge of C#.  So, use my
notes, but verify with the real tutorials offered by thenewboston. 

The reason I posted these tutorials on github, was to learn the process of using github and integrate the use of it with VS 2017.  As I
went along, I noticed many people complaining that they could not see the code.  I had more of a problem with the sound, but made it
through the course and will now share, the code I learned and duplicated from the original tutorials, from Adam, with the newbies to
C#.

It was a fun ride.
