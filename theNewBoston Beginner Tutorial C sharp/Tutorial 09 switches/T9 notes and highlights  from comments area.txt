Switch statements are an alternative to if and else statements.  We will need a button1, textBox1, in a windows form, for 
this first example.  You create a switch by typing, switch, then in parenthersis (the conditions name and type of data 
to be passed), followed by code braces, case, "the data that the condition is compared to", a colon, then the statement to 
be executed, followed by break semicolon. We can have multiple case statements and use default, as else statement,
for when no names are entered or if none of the entered names match the compare arguement:

private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            switch (textBox1.Text)
            {
                case "adam":
                    MessageBox.Show("adam is a match");
                    break;

                case "bob":
                    MessageBox.Show("bob is a match");
                    break;

                default:
                    MessageBox.Show("name entered not a match");
                    break;
            }
        }

We can use the case method, with all the data types.  Create button2 and a textBox2, and we will use ane int variable for our
next example.  Since we are using a set variable that cannot be changed, the way it is constructed in this example, this is
pretty much useless, and is for demostrative purposes only:

        private void button2_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            int i = 0;
            switch (i)
            {
                case 4:
                    MessageBox.Show("i is equal to 4");
                    break;

                case 0:
                    MessageBox.Show("i is equal to 0");
                    break;

                default:
                    MessageBox.Show("number is not a match");
                    break;
            }
            
        }

I never thought the default statement needs a break, It's the end of the switch statement after all. No more cases after it.

Makes sense, but for some reason the program doesn't allow me to debug if I don't have that "debug" after default. I keep 
getting an error message, so I have to put it there.

it actually does else the case would expand indefinitely, without a fixed limit
