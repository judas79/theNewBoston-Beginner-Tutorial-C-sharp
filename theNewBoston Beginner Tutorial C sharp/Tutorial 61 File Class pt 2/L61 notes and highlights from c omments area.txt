For this lesson we will need button1 to learn more about the File class.  We will need and instance for  OpenFileDialog and
a way to check if the path was correctly implimented and a file chosen to be opened, from a previous tutorial.  also make sure you
have using System.IO; in your form1.cs, to access namespace for accessing folders and files.


			// L60 instance of OpenFileDialog
            OpenFileDialog IOFD = new OpenFileDialog();

            // L60 check 'if' the instance makes the path
            if (IOFD.ShowDialog() == System.Windows.Forms.DialogResult.OK)
            {
                MessageBox.Show("IOFD Functional, file selected");

            }


Resuming where we left off last tutorial, we will be examining the File class using the 'copy' method.  The Parameters for the copy
metod are, first a path to the file we want to copy, the a path to where the copy will be copied to.  We will use our open file dialog
instance, to select our FileName, that we want to copy, and a static path to where we will copy it to.  The coppied file will also need
to be renamed along with having an extention specified, at the end of the path, to its destination folder.

				// L61 open path to, select file to copy, use static path to paste renamed file
                string sFileName = "test";
                string sExtension = ".txt";
                //File.Copy(IOFD.FileName, @"C:\Users\Roddy\OneDrive\Documents\VS Test folder\New Sub Folder\" + sFileName + sExtension);
				


The Next method we will use is the Move method.  Its structure is identical to the Copy method, the difference being that the original
file is moved and renamed, so it will not be in its former folder, after it is moved.


                // L61 open path to, select file to move, use static path to paste renamed file
                File.Move(IOFD.FileName, @"C:\Users\Roddy\OneDrive\Documents\VS Test folder\New Sub Folder\New Sub Folder2\" + sFileName + sExtension);
