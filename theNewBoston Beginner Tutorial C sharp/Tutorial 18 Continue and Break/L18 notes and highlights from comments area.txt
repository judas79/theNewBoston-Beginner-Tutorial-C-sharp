Create a button1 and a textBox1 for this tutorial on Continue and Break.  First we will create a for statement that spits,
out some values while it is running.  If we put break before our code to be executed statement, it would break out of the
function and totally skip it:

        private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
            {
				// If we put break here it would skip the following area and everything in it
				break;
                textBox1.Text += i.ToString();  // this line would be skipped
            }
        }

We can use an if statement to choose when the code will break out of the function:
		
        private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
            {
                if (i ==2)
                    break;
                textBox1.Text += i.ToString();
            }
        }
      *
	  |  When i reaches 2, while looping through the for statement, it will jump out to this position '*' in the code.


Make button2, and textBox2, so we can work with a continue example.  Continue, unlike break, loops back into the beginning 
of the function, that it is in, when it hits a set parameter in the if statement.  So, when i reaches 5, while looping, it
will skip the rest of the code to execute, within the statement, and go back up to the begining of the for statement, and 
continue with the next value '6' and continue as up to 10, as it usually would.  When you look at the textBox2, contents, 
you will notice that the number 5 is missing, because the line of code, that said to print it to the textBox was skipped.


        private void button2_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
            {
                if (i == 5)
                    continue;
                textBox2.Text += i.ToString();
            }
        }

Think of it as "continue onto the next iteration", not "skip over the rest of the code"
