In this turorial we well use a button1 and a class, to show how to use a partial keyword.  Set the class up to have a key
field, consisting of a public string, and a public int, each with a value.  If we want to finish difining this class into a
file, we will add partial, to the beginning of the class name.

namespace myNamespace
{
	// L29 partial key
    partial class myClass
    {        
        public string Name = "Mr. Ropper";
        public int Age = 46;
    }
}

If we now made another class with the same name, they would share the things within both parts of the two classes.  So create a
new class file; right click in solution explorer, Add, Class.  Set it up the same as the original class.

namespace myNamespace
{
    // L29 partial key
    partial class myClass
    {
        
        public string HairColor = "Brown";
        public bool Glasses = false;
    }
}

Now the combined fields, 4 of them, belong to both partial classes.  So now we will go over to our button and interact with
our fields.
