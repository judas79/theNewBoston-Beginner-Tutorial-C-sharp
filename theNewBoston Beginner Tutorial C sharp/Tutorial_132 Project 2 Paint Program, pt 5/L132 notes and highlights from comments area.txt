/*
For this lesson we will need all the code from the preceeding tutorials in the Paint app series.  In this lesson we will
write some code to allow the user to drag and drop images into our pannel.  First we will click on our panel and go into
our Properties and change 'AllowDrop' to 'true'.  Then we will go into our Event properties and double click 'DrafOver',
and we can go to its coding area and set the dragover effect to all using our EventsDragEventArgs 'e' to pass in the value.
Next we will double click the DragDrop properties so we can set it to get the images file address.  We will store the files
address in a string array.  We will then iterate throught the image path 'sImgPth'.  Then we will get the object path
of the image from the File, and use our graphics instance 'Ig' to Draw our Image, at the Points of where our mouses 
current coordinates x,y are dragging the image is at.

        private void panel1_DragOver(object sender, DragEventArgs e)
        {
            // L 132 pass in all images through DragEventArgs 'e' using dragdroeffect
            e.Effect = DragDropEffects.All;
        }

        private void panel1_DragDrop(object sender, DragEventArgs e)
        {
            // L132 gets file using get data method object path passed in from DragEventArgs, 
            // puts them paths in string array
            string[] sImgPth = (string[]) e.Data.GetData(DataFormats.FileDrop);

            // L132 iterate through the sImgPth path array, for the paths
            foreach (string sPth in sImgPth)
            {
                // L132 draw the image in our panel using graphics, and Image.fromfile method
                // requires a starting point, to place the image
                Ig.DrawImage(Image.FromFile(sPth), new Point(e.X,e.Y));
            }
